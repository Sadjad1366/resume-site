    "intro": "Iâ€™m Sajad, 38 years old, a frontend developer passionate about React and Next.js.",
    "details": "In the past, I worked in various fields including financial markets and fire alarm & extinguishing systems in the oil and gas industry. But none of those paths made me feel fulfilled. In 2024, I decided to follow my true passion: programming. I joined a 7-month bootcamp focused on React and Next.js, and successfully completed it. Now, I'm eager to pursue my path as a developer and keep growing every day."
